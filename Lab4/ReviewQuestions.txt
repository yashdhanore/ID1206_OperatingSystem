Q1)
FCFS is a simple algorithm which justs serves in first come first serve thus the scheduling would be according to the given qeueu
FCFS: 30 ,183, 98, 14, 122, 37, 67, 124, 65

SCAN algorithm will start with scheduling cyllinders greater than the current one in accending order until the max possible value and the from there on it moves back in a decending order to the cyllinders lesser than the current one.
SCAN: 30, 37, 65, 67, 98, 122, 124, 183, 199, 14 (assuming the cylliders are numbered from 0-199)

C-SCAN is a variation of SCAN which is almost similar however upon reaching the rightmost limit, in C-SCAN the scheduling goes to the least possible cyllinder and then move in an increasing order again untill all cyllinders are visited.
C-SCAN: 30, 37, 65, 67, 98, 122, 124, 183, 199, 0, 14 (assuming the cylliders are numbered from 0-199)

Q2)
The 4,990 users can be added to a single group, and then the allow access feature can be used to provide acess to the file to that group. 
The command : 
chmod 770 filname
can be used for setting such permissions and disabling the access of users outside this group, here the filename must be replaced by the name of the target file.

Q3)
The bit map for file allocation must be kept on mass storage, rather than in main memory as in the case of a system crash (memory failure), the free-space list would not be lost. On the other hand if the bit map were to be stored in main memory, the free-space list would be lost.
